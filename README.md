# Description

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and predicting job matching scores based on candidate resumes and job descriptions. The notebook processes and analyzes resume and job description data to extract meaningful insights and predict matching scores. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and predictive modeling, the project aims to improve hiring efficiency.
# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build a model that predicts the likelihood of a candidate being a good match for a job based on textual resume data. This involves:

-Cleaning and preprocessing text data.

-Extracting key features using TF-IDF and Word2Vec embeddings.

-Training machine learning models (XGBoost and LightGBM) for prediction.

-Evaluating model performance using various metrics.
